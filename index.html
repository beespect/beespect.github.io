          <h2>Reducing Overwintering Losses in Beehives</h2>
          <h3>We aim to perform daily observation and maintenance of hive activities during the winter, to reduce colony losses.</h3>
          <p>
            We want to develop a sensor-enabled beehive capability for commercial beekeepers that aims to reduce colony losses over the winter season, which can be as high as 32% of the colony’s inhabitants. Overwintering losses have increased in recent years due to widespread colony collapse disorder (CCD), which is caused by various stressors to the bees’ microenvironment within the hive. Our device will operate much like a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) having multi-faceted approaches to monitoring the bees’ and queen's behavior, monitoring physical hive conditions and automating treatment against the common <i>Varroa destructor </i> mite.

It is believed that habitat loss, in addition to various stressors, has played a role in honey bee colony collapse. Analysis of land use data in United States has shown that statewise colony loss corresponds to the ratio of open land to developed land area. In states with more open land, there is a higher honey yield per honey bee colony. Increasing losses of foraging resources for honey bees may be compounding the effects of emerging diseases to stress existing honey bee populations, which highlights the importance of preserving natural areas that act as important pollinator habitats.">

              pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide, and is critical in maintaining biodiversity by pollinating any plant species depending on an external pollinator. The Italian honey bee has historically demonstrated good adaptive potential, being found thriving around the globe in quite diverse climates. With regards climate change, honey bees have adapted in the past to long term changes in temperature, showing plasticity and genetic variability that allows them to become suited to altered environmental conditions. Although the impact on honey bees may diminish with time, current trends show that large environmental changes have had a direct negative impact on honey bee development, behavior, physiology and distribution, as well as on the evolution of honey bee interaction with diseases in the short term.">

Economic factors may play a role in falling honey bee colony supply in the United States, but have not been studied extensively. Many almond, avocado and kale farmers in California depend on out-of-state honey bee pollination services to pollinate their crops in the early spring. The recent decline in honey bee colonies puts their livelihood at risk.">

Electromagnetic radiation reduces the motor activity of worker bees on the comb, causing migration from the hive and a gravitation toward sources of electromagnetic radiation. During initial exposure to electropollutants, it is believed that a rise in concentration of various proteins, carbohydrates and lipids occurs. This is perhaps due to stimulation of the honey bee's internal mechanism to fight the stressful conditions brought on. Later on, there has been shown to be a slight decline in the concentration of these organic compounds due to the honey bees' adaption to the radiation stimulus.">

              Pollination services are important for conserving biodiversity and pollinating crops. For numerous generations, colonies of managed honey bees have been imported to fields and orchards. With current colony loss trends, farmers have begun to consider alternatives. On organic farms near natural habitats for native bee populations, such as of the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria), farmers have hoped that native bee species could provide full pollination services for crops with heavy pollination requirements. Butterflies, likewise, could boost the pollination work provided to a crop. This has shown varied rates of success. On other farms, however, there is reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. Conservation and restoration of native bee habitats is essential for creating viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees, but widespread pesticide use makes this difficult.">

Recent studies have suggested that insufficient forage and poor nutrition can exacerbate the impact of infectious viral and fungal diseases, while commonly found parasites and pathogens can harm the honey bee's nutritional physiology. The Varroa destructor mite, in particular, is commonly found in beehives in the United States and is responsible for a significant portion of overwintering losses.">

Improving bees’ nutritional resistance to disease is an important goal to combat challenges to bee health. For these reasons, starvation conditions often present over the winter period, resulting in further losses of hives.">

Honey bees managed close by to corn crops are heavily exposed to neonicotinoids for 3 to 4 months from pollen spread, causing a decrease in honey bee survival and immune responses. This harmful effects are exaggerated if the bees are also exposed to agrochemical fungicide. Neonicotinoid exposure from several pollen sources is known to reduce overwintering success and colony reproduction in both honey bees and wild bees.">
